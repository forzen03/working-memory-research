# Working Memory Research - HCI Project

An academic research project exploring limited working memory capacity and how smart device interfaces are designed to accommodate human cognitive limitations.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project investigates the fundamental human characteristic of **limited working memory capacity** and demonstrates how modern smart devices leverage design principles to reduce cognitive load and enhance user experience.

### Key Concepts
- **Miller's Law**: Humans can hold approximately 7±2 items in working memory at once
- **Chunking**: Breaking information into meaningful groups to reduce cognitive load
- **Recognition over Recall**: Using visual cues instead of requiring memory retrieval

## 📂 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
